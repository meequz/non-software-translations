<p><span style="font-family: Franklin Gothic Medium">Фильм Ричарда Линклейтера 2002 года <em>"Жизнь наяву"</em>целиком посвящён сновидениям и тому, что иногда мы можем их полностью контролировать.
А ещё некоторым большим философским вопросам, в том числе одной из старейших философских головоломок - различию между иллюзией и реальностью.
Когда Рене Декарт сидел за печью и размышлял о мире и о том, что злой демон контролирует всё, им воспринимаемое, он думал: что более реально, жизнь во сне или наяву?
Разношёрстная коллекция персонажей из фильма Линклейтера задаётся тем же вопросом. Тем не менее, они задаются им не только в буквальном смысле, но и в метафорическом, о природе современной культуры и положении человека в целом - каким образом нам удаётся засыпать прямо во время бодрствования?
Как начать вести жизнь <em>более</em> осознанную, с большей осведомленностью о людях и вещах, более подлинную?
В фильме показаны очерки об истоках трёх более-менее различных путей, которыми мы очень легко засыпаем.

<p><span style="font-family: Franklin Gothic Medium">
Эта не новая проблема.
Здесь проходится весь путь обратно к аллегории Платона о пещере: что, если бы вы были всю жизнь прикованы к стене в тускло освещенной пещере, на задней стене которой отражаются тени реальных объектов, проходящих мимо её входа?
И вдруг вы освобождаетесь. Выходите к свету.
Признали бы вы этот новый мир более реальным, чем мир вашей пещеры?
И смогли бы вы убедить тех, кто в ней остался, что за пределами пещерного мира есть большой мир? Смогли бы вы, по Платону, проснуться в реальность?
</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: Franklin Gothic Medium">
Эта идея "пробуждения" - ключевая в всех философских течениях, которые исследуются в фильме.
В древней восточной философии - философии индийской веданты Упанишад, даосизма и буддизма - ключ к пробуждению является просветлением и правильным пониманием отношений между собой и остальным миром.
В экзистенциализме мы должны пробудиться в нашу личную свободу и в нашу ответственность за создание самих себя и жизни.
А в ситуационизме Гая Дебора и других мы должны пробудиться от сахарного очарования потребительского общества.

<img src="waking_essay_files/richardlinklater.jpg" align="right" border="0" height="180" hspace="6" vspace="2" width="225">The
 film was made first by filming live action with a digital video camera,
 then transferring the video to computers, and rotoscoping
(colouring over) the images to turn them into animation. Thirty 
different artists were involved in the process, all with different 
styles.
Rotoscoping has been used before - as early as Disney's 1937 <em>Snow White, </em>and several decades later in Ralph Bakshi's <em>The Lord of the
Rings </em>and <em>American Pop. </em>It gives a flowing, surreal, 
dreamlike quality to much of the film, surely Linklater's intention. And
 although the
film is divided into 34 more or less distinct shorts, they're linked 
together by the constant presence of the "dreamer," Wiley Wiggins,
who also acted in Linklater's <em>Dazed and Confused</em>. In addition, the shorts are linked by most of them taking place in Linklater's home
town of Austin, Texas, and by thematic links between the ideas presented in adjacent scenes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: Franklin Gothic Medium">To understand the 
structure of the film and to keep track of what's happening in each of 
its scenes, I've named and outlined each
scene in the following chart.  Each scene has been titled (using those 
provided by the DVD track list where feasible), briefly
described, and situated in terms of the main philosophical ideas found 
in them. I've also indicated which ones I consider to be axial
scenes when it comes to a philosophical understanding of the film along 
the lines set out in this essay.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: Franklin Gothic Medium">As I've said, the 
central issue in the film is dreaming. The idea of lucid dreaming, of 
knowing that you're dreaming and thus being able
to exert some control over your dreams, has been explored by dream 
researcher Stephen Laberge of the Lucidity Institute, whose
ideas are alluded to in the film.  The first scene of the film, Dream is
 Destiny, features Wiley as a child playing with a young girl outside
a house. They're making an origami fortune teller, which when they open 
it up tells them "dream is destiny." Wiley then walks over
to a car, grabs its handle, and starts to float away. We return to this 
locale 
in the very last scene in the film, when Wiley floats
away once again. We get the sense from the way the film is framed by 
these two scenes that in the dream world time is an illusion - Wiley's
present and past mix together fairly seamlessly. More obviously, we 
realize from these scenes that the whole film is a lucid dream,
one which Wiley can control only in part.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: Franklin Gothic Medium">
<img src="waking_essay_files/tianahux.jpg" align="left" border="0" height="237" hspace="12" width="189">In
 Scene 24, The Human Ant Colony, Wiley is stopped by performance artist 
Tiana Hux, who engages him in a fairly long
conversation on a variety of subjects (I'll return to this important 
scene a couple of more times). Notably, the animator has given the
scene the look of a Picasso or Matisse painting - the characters have 
oversized eyes as in <em>Les Desmoiselles d'Avignon;</em> the background
 is
primitivist and abstract. Wiley asks her directly, what's it like to be a
 character in a dream? She avoids answering the question, but
does tell him that given the fact that he's dreaming, he can do whatever
 he wants. "You have so many options, and that's what life is
about," she says. So from discovering the fact that Wiley is dreaming, 
Linklater brings up the question of human freedom, and
indirectly that of authenticity. "It's up to you to choose what you want
 to do with your life," he in effect says, "so don't wait around
for others to make your choices for you."    </span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: Franklin Gothic Medium">We get further 
evidence of the power of the dream state in Scene 19, Dreamers Muse, 
where Wiley visits three men in a white
room. The first one, Jason Hodge, explains to Wiley that our brain 
chemistry inhibited hallucinations early in our evolutionary
development so that we didn't confuse images of predators with real 
ones. But in dreams this inhibition is lifted, and we're free to
have "hallucinations," which from point of view of brain chemistry are 
no more or less real than our waking perceptions. This
becomes important when the second man in the white room, Guy Forsyth, 
explains that "the trick is to combine your waking,
rational abilities with the infinite possibilities of your dreams, 
because if you can do that, you can do anything." Once again, dreaming
in related to freedom and creativity. But this time, there's an 
evolutionary imperative mixed in to explain the limitations of waking 
life
as compared to the freedom of the dream world - to survive, we had to 
learn to distinguish the dream from the waking worlds.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: Franklin Gothic Medium">The actual idea of 
lucid dreaming is briefly mentioned by an elderly lady seen on a 
television show Wiley watches briefly in Scene 18,
Lucid Dreams. She links lucid dreaming to a "venerable tradition of 
sorcerers, shamans, and other visionaries," who were able to
control their dreams. Scene 27, Channel Surfing, finds Wiley back in 
front of his television. The woman reappears, suggesting that
perhaps after we die our consciousness continues in a dream body, never 
again waking. This suggestion is followed up in key Scene
33, The Tango of Yes, where Linklater plays pinball as he talks to 
Wiley. He reveals a dream he himself had of Lady Gregory, 
W. B. Yeats'
patron, in the Land of the Dead. In the dream he learns that God poses a
 question to all of us when we dream: do we want to join
him in eternity, or return to waking life? We live our lives constantly 
saying "no" to God's question, until we eventually say "yes," and
shuffle off the mortal coil. Yet it's important to note that Linklater 
is eager to leave the putrid-smelling Land of the Dead, to say no to
eternity at least this time, to return to waking life. He also tells 
Wiley that it's easy to wake up, waving his hands over his eyes in a 
sort
of sorcerer's spell. Yet Wiley winds up waking into just another level 
of his lucid dream, ending the movie.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: Franklin Gothic Medium">Our first wake up 
call is that from attachment to the past, to the ego as an individual 
and unconnected entity, and to material things
over the spiritual unity of the universe. This call awakens us to our 
connection to everything around us, and to a meaningful life.<a href="#N_1_"><sup> (1)</sup></a></span></p>

<p><font face="Franklin Gothic Medium">The first of three themes taken 
from Eastern philosophy has to with Vedanta, by which I mean ancient 
Indian thought first presented
in the Upanishads and later systematized by thinkers like Shankara.<a href="#N_2_"><sup> (2)</sup></a>
 The Vedantists argued that Atman is Brahman, and Brahman is
Atman - the soul is the universe, and the universe is contained in every
 soul. There is only one reality, which we can call God if we
like, and which is represented by Aum, the sacred syllable.  They also 
believed that bad karma can trap us in the senses and the
physical body, and that we must seek release from a narrow view of the 
self as physical and individual, to enlighten our consciousness
to our connection to all things.</font></p>

<p><font face="Franklin Gothic Medium">The Upanishads argue that there 
is a higher self that watches over the more mundane self caught up in 
the world of the senses and
the cycle of rebirth. The Brihadaranyaka Upanishad puts it this way:</font></p>
<blockquote>
	<p><font face="Franklin Gothic Medium">It is said of these states of 
consciousness that in the dreaming state, where one is sleeping, the 
shining Self, who never dreams, who is
ever awake, watches by his own light the dreams woven out of past deeds 
and present desires. In the dream state, when one is
sleeping, the shining Self keeps the body alive with the vital force of 
prana, and wanders wherever he wills. (Easwaran 44-45).</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font face="Franklin Gothic Medium">More systematically, the ancient 
writers of the Upanishads argued that there are in fact four levels of 
consciousness, and that the
dream state is <em>higher </em>than that experienced in waking life 
(though there are two higher states still). The Mandukya Upanishad
(Easwaran 60-61) argues that these four levels of consciousness are (1) 
our waking awareness of the external world, (2) the dream
state, (3) a dreamless sleep, and (4) a superconscious state where we 
use neither our senses nor our intellect. This fourth state,
<em>Turiya </em>in Sanskrit, is where we are one with Brahman. It is the shining self referred to above.</font></p>

<p><font face="Franklin Gothic Medium">Shankara argued that Brahman is 
the one absolute reality which underlies all external appearances. 
Further, he noted that just as
dream objects seem unreal only when we wake up and experience them with 
our waking consciousness, when we wake up to the
higher reality of Brahman, we see ordinary sense experience as a sort of
 dream. Only Brahman is real. We might see a rope at a
distance and think it's a snake, but when we view it close up, we 
realize our ignorance. Our belief in the ultimate reality of normal
waking life is a similar sort of ignorance (Kollers 77). </font> </p>

<p><font face="Franklin Gothic Medium">We see these ideas in several 
scenes. Most fundamentally, Wiley's dream self "wanders wherever he 
wills," to quote the Upanishads.
He floats in and out of new situations, meeting a wide variety of people
 in his dream wanderings. We also get a clear sense of how
ordinary consciousness puts off communion with the whole - our Atman is 
under normal conditions unaware of Brahman. In Scene 4,
Signifier and Signified, Kim Krizan (co-screenwriter of Linklater's 
earlier film <em>After Sunrise) </em>argues that words were designed to
transcend our alienation from each other, but are in reality dead and 
inert symbols. Yet if we can use them to truly communicate, to
achieve spiritual communion, we can free our consciousness. She says 
that this sense of spiritual communion is what we live for. This
could well be the Vedanta notion of <em>Turiya, </em>the highest state of consciousness.</font></p>

<p><font face="Franklin Gothic Medium">Hints of unity with Brahman 
appear in several other places in the film. In Scene 12, Liminal 
Experiences, Aklilu Gebrewold speaks of
liminal experiences becoming more frequent, and of a radical 
subjectivity opening itself to a vast objectivity, a moment which 
contains
the whole universe, a very Vedantist turn of phrase. In Scene 23, One 
Thousand Years, Ryan Power, an autistic 13-year old, says that
1000 years is but an instant, implying that time is unreal seen from 
some higher perspective. And Scene 20, The Holy Moment,
although ostensibly about Andr&#233; Bazin's theory of the cinema, echoes 
Vedantist ideas: when the camera captures a moment of reality,
it is capturing God, since God is in all things. If Shankara were a film
 director, this is surely something he would have understood.</font></p>

<p><font face="Franklin Gothic Medium">
<img src="waking_essay_files/rock%2520garden%2520animated.gif" align="left" border="0" height="165" hspace="8" width="182">To
 clinch the connection, in Scene 33, The Tango of Yes, Linklater himself
 says that in his dream of Lady Gregory she told him that
"there's only one instant, and it's right now, and it's eternity": in 
other words, Atman is Brahman. And there's only one story - do you
say No or Yes to God's invitation to enter eternity? Here is yet more 
evidence for the presence of the Vedantist idea of cosmic
monism in the film.</font></p>

<p><font face="Franklin Gothic Medium">Our second Eastern philosophy, 
Taoism, is powered by its belief in the Tao, or the Way, which is 
natural, spontaneous, and balanced.
It is a mysterious universal force underlying all of nature which cannot
 be precisely named. Lao Tzu starts the <em>Tao Te Ching </em>with an
attempt at describing it:</font></p>

<blockquote>
	<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
	<font face="Franklin Gothic Medium">The Tao that can be told is not the eternal Tao.</font></p>
	<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
	<font face="Franklin Gothic Medium">The name that can be named is not the eternal name.</font></p>
	<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
	<font face="Franklin Gothic Medium">The nameless is the beginning of heaven and Earth</font></p>
	<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
	<font face="Franklin Gothic Medium">The named is the mother of the ten thousand things.</font></p>
	<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
	<font face="Franklin Gothic Medium">Ever desireless, one can see the mystery.
	</font></p>
	<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
	<font face="Franklin Gothic Medium">Ever desiring, one sees the manifestations.</font></p>
	<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
	<font face="Franklin Gothic Medium">These two spring from the same source but differ in name; this appears as darkness.</font></p>
	<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">

	<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
	<font face="Franklin Gothic Medium">The gate to all mystery. (<em>Tao Te Ching
	</em>1, Feng translation)</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font face="Franklin Gothic Medium">Water is an important Taoist metaphor: though soft, it can wear down the hardest rock. The metaphor of water wearing down rock
is part of the general Taoist idea that suppleness and not striving can overcome strength over time:</font></p>

<blockquote>
	<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
	<font face="Franklin Gothic Medium">Under heaven nothing is more soft and yielding than water,</font></p>
	<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
	<font face="Franklin Gothic Medium">Yet for attacking the solid and strong, nothing is better;</font></p>
	<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
	<font face="Franklin Gothic Medium">It has no equal. (<em>Tao Te Ching </em>78) 
	</font></p>
	<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
	<font face="Franklin Gothic Medium">The softest thing in the universe</font></p>
	<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
	<font face="Franklin Gothic Medium">Overcomes the hardest thing in the universe. 
	<em>(Tao Te Ching </em>43)</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font face="Franklin Gothic Medium">Taoists advocate <em>wu wei, </em>which is literally "non-action," but means more generally spontaneous or natural action. Following this
principle allows us to live in peace with nature and to find tranquillity.</font></p>

<p><font face="Franklin Gothic Medium">The Taoists see the universe as held together by <em>ch'i,</em>
 breath or Life Energy. It is in constant flux, balanced by the Tao. The
 self has no
fixed identity - as in Buddhism, it's constantly changing, constantly 
flowing. We should live in the moment, and not be overcome by
our desires. Too much attachment breeds unhappiness:</font></p>

<blockquote>
	<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
	<font face="Franklin Gothic Medium">He who is attached to things will suffer much.</font></p>
	<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
	<font face="Franklin Gothic Medium">He who saves will suffer heavy loss.</font></p>
	<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
	<font face="Franklin Gothic Medium">A contented man is never disappointed. (<em>Tao Te Ching
	</em>44)</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font face="Franklin Gothic Medium">Also connected with Taoism is the <em>I Ching, </em>or Book of Changes, which contains a method of divining the future, and the idea that the
universe is balanced between Yin and Yang, the female and male principles.</font></p>

<p><font face="Franklin Gothic Medium">We see Taoism in several places in <em>Waking Life. </em>Scene
 2, Anchors Aweigh, the 
"Boatisattva" Bill Wise advises Wiley to "go with the
flow," a Taoist metaphor rendered into modern language. In fact, the 
whole oddness of the image of a boat driving down a city street
reinforces the watery nature of the start of Wiley's journey. The scene 
also evokes the <em>I Ching </em>when Bill Wise tells Wiley that even if
he makes a random choice as to his destination, it will determine his 
fate. Wiley's choice isn't too natural, for after he debarks from
the boat car he gets run over and wakes into another dream.</font></p>

<p><font face="Franklin Gothic Medium">
<img src="waking_essay_files/juliedelpyethanhawke.jpg" align="right" border="0" height="300" hspace="8" width="375">Scene
 7, Collective Memory, finds Julie Delpy and Ethan Hawke in bed. Delpy 
says that she sometimes thinks she's observing her life
from the perspective of an old woman, looking back on her life. Hawke 
muses that a second of dream consciousness could be
equivalent to whole minutes of waking life. These musings hint at the 
Taoist philosopher Chuang Tzu's paradoxes concerning
appearance and reality and his notion that perspective is always 
relative - the way something appears to <em>you </em>might be quite different
from the way it appears to <em>me. </em>He illustrated this idea with a 
story: he once woke up from a dream of being a butterfly, but couldn't
decide whether he was a man who dreamed he was a butterfly, or a 
butterfly dreaming he was a man. Similarly, this scene poses the
riddle: is Delpy the old woman dreaming of her lost youth, or the young 
woman dreaming of some future state?</font></p>

<p><font face="Franklin Gothic Medium">Scene 31, Garden and Portrait, is
 a wordless one where see a small waterfall flowing over rocks emptying 
into a peaceful pool of
water. In the pool we see goldfish. A cat prowls around its edge. In 
this very harmonious Taoist garden an old woman is drawing
portraits, showing Wiley a sketch she's done of him at the end. This 
brief scene is doubly Taoist: it pictures natural harmony, and does
so without naming it, without words.</font></p>

<p><font face="Franklin Gothic Medium">The main Eastern influence on <em>Waking Life </em>is
 Buddhism. The Buddha was the Awakened One. He believed that all life 
was suffering,
but this could be limited by limiting our cravings or desires. We suffer
 because we are too attached to the past, the future, others,
material things, and our selves as unchanging entities. Buddhism asks us
 to wake up from our false belief in and attachment to the
permanence of things, including the permanence of the individual ego, 
and to embrace the reality of the now.</font></p>

<p><font face="Franklin Gothic Medium">A key Buddhist concept is <em>interdependent arising, </em>sometime referred to as dependent origination. It means simply that everything is
connected. One of the reasons we experience <em>dukkha, </em>or 
suffering, is our refusal to see the interconnected and ever-changing 
nature
of things. The self is always in flux. Nothing is permanent: it is 
empty, sunyata, to borrow Nagarjuna's term. Enlightenment, nirvana,
can only come once we let go of our attachment to the permanence of the 
self, at least the self as a fixed entity. One way to do this is
by practising mindfulness, by being aware of the reality all around us. 
This is especially important because our karma is always ebbing
and flowing, so being mindful of the effects of our actions on others is
 especially important for the Buddhist. Mahayana Buddhism later 
introduced the idea of a Bodhisattva, or spiritual guide, to help us 
reach enlightenment. The Bodhisattva
compassionately puts off nirvana so he or she can remain in the world of
 the senses and help others.</font></p>

<p><font face="Franklin Gothic Medium"><em>
<img src="waking_essay_files/bodi%2520tree.jpg" align="left" border="0" height="238" hspace="10" width="277">Waking Life</em>
 starts with a Bodhisattva helping Wiley on his way. In Scene 2, Anchors
 Aweigh, Bill Wise appears in his boat car to act as
Wiley's "boatisattva", his spiritual guide at the start of his lucid 
dream. Interestingly, Linklater himself is also in the car. Wise is in a
state of constant departure, always in flux, always ready to ship out. 
Naturally, the idea of being in a state of constant departure<em> is</em> the
Buddhist notion of the self: never fixed, always in flux. </font> </p>

<p><font face="Franklin Gothic Medium">In Scene 11, Say Yes to 
Existence, Otto Hoffman, a Quaker, asks us to liberate ourselves from 
the negative and to say Yes to one
instant, and thus to all existence. In other words, we should live in 
the now and not be attached to the past or possible futures. This
point is reinforced in Scene 22, The Train Arrives, when David Martinez 
debarks from a train and tells Wiley not to be bored because
"this is absolutely the most exciting time we could have possibly hoped 
to be alive." The reality of the now comes up a third time in
Scene 25, The Ongoing Wow, where Timothy "Speed" Levitch, a wild and 
wacky New York poet and tour guide, tells Wiley that the
"ongoing WOW is happening right now," and that life understood is life 
lived. This scene is rotoscoped with psychedelic colours and
patterns, stars floating in the air, and an exploding hairdo on Levitch 
that reminds one of a 1960s Bob Dylan poster. It's an important
scene because all three of our major themes - Buddhism, existentialism 
and situationism - are mixed together in Levitch's mad rant.
Be that as it may, we get repeated reminders from Linklater's characters
 of the need to be aware of the reality of present instant, the
ongoing wow of the now, a central tenet of Buddhism.</font></p>

<p><font face="Franklin Gothic Medium">Throughout the film Wiley is 
asked to pay attention, to be mindful, of the swirl of experience going 
on around him. This is perhaps
indicated by the appearance of a beautiful young woman in the bus 
station at the beginning of Scene 2, then again in Scene 26, when
she asks if he remembers her (he says he doesn't). Her kind face is a 
reminder to Wiley to focus his compassion on his immediate
world, and not on distant people and things.</font></p>

<p><font face="Franklin Gothic Medium">Scene 24, The Human Ant Colony, 
follows up on this theme. Tiana Hux confronts Wiley with the need to be 
awake to the reality of
all encounters, to practise mindfulness. She tells him that she doesn't 
want to wander around on "ant autopilot" all the time, but
wants instead some real human moments. Wiley confesses that he has been 
on zombie autopilot a lot lately, recounting the D. H.
Lawrence story of two people meeting on a road and deciding to "accept 
what he calls the confrontation between their souls." So the
reality of the ongoing wow requires this sort of confrontation, a 
mindfulness of the existence of the other.</font></p>

<p><font face="Franklin Gothic Medium">In Scene 13, The Aging Paradox, 
two women - Carol Dawson, a novelist, and Lisa Moore, an English 
professor - discuss the aging
paradox. As they get older, they feel they have more time, not being 
attached to the rigid goals of their youth. As young women they
felt an eager desperation to reach a plateau in their lives somewhere in
 their thirties. Yet when they got there, this desperation
evaporated, and they felt a greater freedom. They also discuss how we 
have to use things like old photos to construct an identity
which links our present to our past selves, even though this identity is
 essentially a fiction. In fact, our cells regenerate every seven
years, so we shed off the skin of several selves in the course of a 
lifetime. Moore and Dawson have seemingly thrown off their
attachments to an illusory future and to the fixed nature of their 
selves. 
</font> </p>

<p><font face="Franklin Gothic Medium">We see further Buddhist themes in
 Scene 30, when Mona Lee says our self is just a logical structure, a 
"place to momentarily house all
the abstractions," and that in times past life was raging all around 
her, and "every moment was magical." Lastly, Scene 7 makes a brief
allusion to the ideas of reincarnation and collective memory found in 
Tibetan Buddhism. Julie Delpy dismisses reincarnation as a real
metaphysical possibility due to the fact that with so many "new" people 
in the world over the last forty years, it's difficult to figure out
where all these new souls came from. However, she sees reincarnation as a
 poetic expression of something that is more substantial,
collective memory. Ethan Hawke offers as evidence of collective memory a
 study that showed when people were given day-old <em>New
York Times </em>crossword puzzles, their collective scores went up 20%, even though they had never seen the puzzles before. Why?
Because others around them <em>had </em>seen these puzzles, and had somehow communicated their solutions to the test group via some sort
of collective consciousness.</font></p>

<p><font face="Franklin Gothic Medium">So our first wake-up call ends 
with the Buddhist notions of the reality of the now, of the changing 
self, and of the need for
mindfulness. Ironically, the Buddhist idea of a self constantly in flux 
contradicts the much more substantial Vedantist self, which is one
with Brahman. Yet Linklater has allowed this contradiction to stand in 
his film, seemingly embracing both sides of the dialectic at once.</font></p>

<p><font face="Franklin Gothic Medium" size="4"><strong>
<img src="waking_essay_files/alexjones.jpg" align="left" border="0" height="210" hspace="8" width="263">3. Second Wake-Up Call: Existentialism and the Call to Freedom</strong></font></p>

<p><font face="Franklin Gothic Medium">The second wake up call in <em>Waking Life </em>comes
 from existentialism, especially Jean-Paul Sartre's notions that we are 
condemned to be
free, and that if we make excuses for our not having this freedom, we 
are living in bad faith. Sartre distinguished in-itself physical
being, like that of rocks, which have no consciousness and thus no 
freedom, from for-itself conscious being, which we human beings
have. As in-itself beings, we are fundamentally free to make our own 
choices, to chart our own course in life. Brute matter may
frustrate our plans, yet we always have a choice. We are thrown into 
this world, and it's up to us to do the best job we can at creating
our selves, much as an artist strives to paint an evocative painting, or
 a sculptor chisels away at a mass of rock to create a compelling
statue.</font></p>

<p><font face="Franklin Gothic Medium">For Sartre, every time we make an
 excuse for not doing something we desire or feel obligated to do, we 
are living in bad faith. On
the other side, if we blindly follow the dictates of social custom or 
the commands of others, and refuse to take responsibility for our
actions, we are once again in bad faith. Since we are responsible for 
creating our own actions, we are responsible for creating our
selves. We need to wake up to the reality of this act of creation, of 
our personal freedom. So the wake up call here is to freedom, to
the acceptance of a transcendent <em>being-for-itself</em> that isn't enchained by the grimy materialism of the body or by the slightly less grimy
socialization of our economic and social roles.</font></p>

<p><font face="Franklin Gothic Medium">The key scene here is Scene 3, Condemned to be Free, when Wiley Wiggins, our hero, visits Robert C. Solomon, an important
commentator on and champion of existential thought. He doesn't like the socially constructed and fragmented self of the
postmodernists: this just opens up a whole world of excuses. What we do in our lives does make a difference. In Solomon's own
words:</font></p>

<blockquote>
	<p><font face="Franklin Gothic Medium">[Solomon in the classroom]... 
The reason why I refuse to take existentialism as just another French 
fashion, or historical curiosity, is
that I think it has something very important to offer us for the new 
century. I'm afraid we're losing the real virtues of living life
passionately, in the sense of taking responsibility for who you are, the
 ability to make something of yourself and feeling good about
life. Existentialism is often discussed as if it's a philosophy of 
despair, but I think the truth is just the opposite. Sartre once 
interviewed
said he never really felt a day of despair in his life. The one thing 
that comes out from reading these guys is not a sense of anguish
about life, so much as a real kind of exuberance, of feeling on top of 
it. It's like, your life is yours to create... [Solomon and Wiley
walking] I've read the post-modernists with some interest, even 
admiration. But, when I read them I always have this awful, nagging
feeling like something absolutely essential is getting left out. The 
more that you talk about a person as a social construction, or as a
confluence of forces, or as fragmented or marginalized, what you do is 
you open up a whole new world of excuses. And when Sartre
talks about responsibility, he's not talking about something abstract. 
He's not talking about the kind of self or soul that theologians
would argue about. It's something very concrete; it's you and me 
talking, making decisions, doing things and taking the consequences.
(<em>Waking Life, </em>Scene 3)</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font face="Franklin Gothic Medium">Solomon's monologue hints at the 
idea of everyday life held by most people, including the postmodernist 
ideological justification of
this life: the idea that we are pushed and shoved by large institutions 
like corporations and the state, or are trapped in our roles as
members of a given sex, race, or religion. The existentialists critique 
this idea as radically underestimating our personal responsibility
for our actions. Given a Whiggish theory of history, one might think 
that the more recent (historically speaking) postmodernists, with
their socially constructed view of the self, would trump the 
"old-fashioned" existentialist view of the self as transcendental and
fundamentally free. But not so for Solomon, and one would imagine 
Linklater. The fat lady has yet to sing in the arena of personal
responsibility. Matter and social roles are tests of our freedom: can we
 transcend them, or do we surrender to in-itself being,
becoming moving blobs of flesh and bones animated by nothing more than 
custom and habit?</font></p>

<p><font face="Franklin Gothic Medium">Existentialist freedom arises 
again in Scene 25, when Speed Levitch waves his hands like a sorcerer, 
excitedly informing Wiley that:</font></p>

<blockquote>
	<p><font face="Franklin Gothic Medium">
	<img src="waking_essay_files/speedlevitch.jpg" align="right" border="0" height="210" hspace="6" width="263">We
 are all co-authors of this dancing exuberance, for even our inabilities
 are having a roast. We are the authors of ourselves, co-authoring a 
gigantic Dostoevsky novel starring clowns. This entire thing we're 
involved with called the world is an opportunity to
exhibit how exciting alienation can be. Life is a matter of a miracle 
that is collected over time by moments flabbergasted to be in each
others' presence. The world is an exam, to see if we can rise into the 
direct experiences. Our eyesight is here as a test, to see if we
can see beyond it. Matter is here as a test for our curiosity. Doubt is 
here as an exam for our vitality. Thomas Mann wrote that he
would rather participate in life than write a hundred stories. 
Giacometti was once run down by a car, and he recalled falling into a
lucid faint - a sudden exhilaration as he realized at last, something 
was happening to him. (<em>Waking Life, 
	</em>Scene 25)</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="left">
<font face="Franklin Gothic Medium">Here are some all too familiar 
existentialist themes: we write our own lives, the self is made over 
time through experience, and physical matter is a sort of test for our 
willingness to live in good faith, to exert our freedom. Of course, 
Levitch's existentialism is mixed in with some jolly Buddhism and some 
self-affirming situationism: the gigantic Dostoevsky novel that is our 
lives stars <em>clowns,</em> not Raskalnikov or the brothers Karamazov. 
Yet it is an existentialism all the same. Alienation is exciting, doubt a
 test of our vitality. Perhaps one-third Sartre, one-third Nietzsche, 
and one-third Camus in one of his happier moods.</font></p>

<p><font face="Franklin Gothic Medium">As a counterpoint to all this 
freedom, in Scene 9, Free Will and Physics, philosophy professor David 
Sosa brings up a central criticism
of existentialism, the idea that we live in a pre-determined universe. 
He starts by discussing a basic problem faced by medieval
Christian thinkers like St. Thomas: if God is all-powerful and knows 
everything that will ever happen, how can human action be seen
as free? This is the same question posed by modern science, transferring
 the power to determine events from God to natural laws. In
his speech Sosa in effect asks, "how can we have free will if we're just
 bundles of matter and energy determined by physical laws?" It
doesn't do any good to bring in quantum mechanics with its probabilistic
 account of the random swerving of atomic particles - this
hardly preserves human dignity. Sosa prefers a "deterministic physical 
machine" to such swerving. He concludes without a real
solution, insisting that we can't ignore the problems of choice and of 
freedom, since our very notions of responsibility and of
individuality depend on our understanding this problem.</font></p>

<p><font face="Franklin Gothic Medium">
<img src="waking_essay_files/nietzsche%2520bw.gif" align="left" border="0" height="288" hspace="8" width="258">A
 second major more-or-less existentialist thinker hinted at a number of 
times in the film is Friedrich Nietzsche. Nietzsche argues
that all life is will to power. Yet the will to power of some is weak 
and dyspeptic - they follow a slave morality which celebrates pity,
physical illness, and servitude. Those bursting with a more positive 
will to power can master both themselves and others. They revel
in creativity, struggle, and self-mastery. They embrace master morality.
 Nietzsche was no democrat - he saw the greater mass of
humanity as bleating sheep whose chief preoccupation was avoiding 
marauding birds of prey. For him, they invent slave morality to
enslave their enemies in mind-forged manacles of self-renunciation and 
self-pity. The true test of the presence of master morality was
the <em>amor fati,</em> or love of fate. What if the universe eternally recurred, eventually repeating your life just as it is now? Could you
embrace this fate? Live your life over again just as it is now? If you say "yes," then you love fate, and are indeed a master. 
</font> </p>

<p><font face="Franklin Gothic Medium">We've already seen how in Scene 
11 Otto Hoffman asks us to say Yes to all existence. Seen from this 
point of view, his claim that the
essence of the human quest is to be "liberated from the negative" 
parallels Nietzsche's own attempt to escape from the nihilism that
he saw engulfing European civilization all around him. Hoffman's "Yes" 
to existence can also be seen (in addition to its Buddhist
connotations) as evoking Nietzsche's <em>amor fati, </em>love of fate.</font></p>

<p><font face="Franklin Gothic Medium">A more aggressive Nietzschean can
 be seen in Scene 15, which I've called The Overman. Here Louis Mackey 
says that there are two
types of people in the world, "those who suffer from a lack of life, and
 those who suffer from an over-abundance of life." These
roughly parallel Nietzsche's master and slave moralities. Mackey goes on
 to suggest that the distance between the average person and
Plato or Nietzsche is greater than that between a chimp and an ordinary 
human. So few of us reach our real potentials, become great
artists, saints or philosophers. Why? Mackey says that the answer to 
this simple question can be found in another - what's the more
universal human characteristic, fear, or laziness? However we reply to 
this second question - one assumes that the true answer is "a
mixture of both" - Mackey's short monologue hints strongly at Overman, 
the higher type of human being who embraces master
morality, who overcomes all obstacles to achieving his full potential. 
Even the most dedicated Nietzsche scholars debate over who
are the best examples of Nietzsche's Overman. He himself seems to 
suggest Napoleon and Goethe, diverse human types to be sure,
one a military conqueror, the other a poet. Whichever pole we think more
 accurately reflects Nietzsche's Overman, we can be sure
that most of us are neither  Napoleons or Goethes. At the end of our 
lives, we are probably closer to being animals that Overmen -
we eat, sleep, have babies, go to work, watch television, but produce 
nothing great. Our names are erased from history with the
millions of others who have led similarly humdrum if not slavish lives. 
Sadly, most of us are Nietzsche's bleating sheep, ever watchful
of the circling birds of prey, the truly "evil" masters of their own 
fates.</font></p>

<p><font face="Franklin Gothic Medium">Finally, Scene 33 returns us to 
Nietzsche's eternal recurrence. Linklater, speaking of his dream of Lady
 Gregory, talks about how
there is only one story, moving from the "No" to the "Yes," embracing 
eternity and the unity of things underneath their phenomenal
differences. With a bit of a stretch we can see this once again as 
Nietzsche's rejection of nihilism and his challenge that we embrace
life and fate, even if it eternally recurs. So whether it's Sartre's 
clarion call to freedom, or Nietzsche's demand that we become
masters of our own selves and destinies, <em>Waking Life </em>oozes existentialist ideas out of its many cracks and fissures. There remains one
more major philosophical theme on display in the film, a theme which, historically speaking, was very much a continuation of
existentialism.</font></p>

<hr>
<p><font face="Franklin Gothic Medium" size="4"><strong>4. Third Wake-Up Call: Situationism and the Consumer Spectacle</strong></font></p>

<p><font face="Franklin Gothic Medium">Our third theme is the 
situtationism of Guy Debord and Raoul Vaneigem, French thinkers and 
activists whose work culminated in two
major theoretical statements, both published in 1967: Debord's <em>The Society of the Spectacle, </em>and Vaneigem's <em>The Revolution of Everyday
Life. </em>The situationists see modern consumer society as a society of the spectacle where our selves are absorbed into the mass
entertainments provided by film, TV, pop music, advertising, and consumer goods. Authenticity is swallowed up by the passivity
encouraged by absorption in the spectacle. In Debord's own words:</font></p>

<blockquote>
	<p><font face="Franklin Gothic Medium">[The spectacle] is the sun which
 never sets on the empire of modern passivity. It covers the entire 
surface of the world and bathes
endlessly in its own glory. (Debord, paragraph 13)</font></p>
	<p><font face="Franklin Gothic Medium">The economic system is a <em>circular production of isolation. 
	</em>The technology is based on isolation, and the technical process isolates in
turn. From the automobile to television, all the <em>goods selected </em>by the spectacular system are also its weapons for a constant
reinforcement of the conditions of isolation of "lonely crowds." (Debord, 
	paragraph 28)</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font face="Franklin Gothic Medium">We live in a world so dominated 
by consumer goods that even our social relations are commodified. We 
relate to others through
cars, stereos, mass-produced music, TV shows and vacation packages. We 
live in a world of illusions created by our endless pursuit of
commodities: for Debord, we are literally "consumers of illusions" 
(P47). The spectacle breeds isolation, and alienates us from
meaningful work, play and communities. We are caught up in false choices
 between spectacles in a society which offers us spectacular
abundance, yet at the same time separates us from each other and from 
active resistance to the cultural alienation this society
represents. These commodities fight epic battles as "vaporous qualities"
 empty of substance, lacking the reality of even mythical
heroes such as Achilles and Hector (Debord P62, 66). Yet they easily 
slip into our emotional lives by means of the Trojan Horses of
advertising, television, movies and other agencies of the society of the
 spectacle.</font></p>

<p><font face="Franklin Gothic Medium">The situationists had a number of
 interesting ideas about how to deal with the society of the spectacle. 
They said "never work," a
solution that many of them acted out in their lives. They proposed 
creating everyday "situations" to make everyday life more than a
manufactured consumer spectacle; they supported "d&#233;tournements," the 
rearranging, mocking, or defacing of important cultural
object to subvert their meaning; and they suggested we drift around town
 (they called these drifts <em>d&#233;rives), </em>soaking up the
atmosphere of each quarter. Their explorations of the contemporary urban
 environment led them to speculate about its
"psychogeography," arguing that a revolution in everyday life required a
 more liveable architecture, one that encouraged desire and
play. Although much of the situationist program crashed and burned after
 the failure of the May 1968 anti-Gaullist revolt in France,
punk rock and the more recent culture jamming movement, with Kalle Lasn 
and his magazine <em>Adbusters </em>leading the charge, keep
them alive.                       </font>                       </p>

<p><font face="Franklin Gothic Medium">
<img src="waking_essay_files/waking%2520life%2520situationists.jpg" align="right" border="0" height="225" hspace="10" width="333">Situationism
 is explicitly referenced in Scene 21, Society is a Fraud, when four 
young men (including Nicki Katt and Adam Goldberg,
Linklater regulars) go on a <em>d&#233;rive</em>, eventually visiting "Mr. 
Debord" (played by Austin shopkeeper and poet Hymie Samuelson - the real
Debord  committed suicide in 1993). On the way there they exchange 
situationist-style jargon like wanting to rupture the spell of the
ideology of consumer society to open up ourselves to authentic desires, 
to interrupt the continuum of everyday existence, to pursue
intensities of love and hate, to live as if something actually depended 
on one's actions. One of them proclaims that "society is a fraud
so complete and venal that it demands to be destroyed beyond the power 
of memory to recall its existence." Another wants "an
affirmation of freedom so reckless and unqualified, that it amounts to a
 total denial of every kind of restraint and limitation." The
situationism of these four wanderers is uttered with an intense 
earnestness. Yet Linklater throws in some humour at the end of the
scene to lighten the situation: they see an older man stuck up a 
telephone pole who doesn't know why he's there. One of the
situationists comments that just as he's all action and no theory, they 
are all theory and no action, a chronic problem with the avant-garde 
Left.</font></p>

<p><font face="Franklin Gothic Medium">Scene 4, with Kim Krizan, is 
about how we can overcome alienation through spiritual communion, 
understanding each other through
words like "love." This is evidence of the more poetic, positive side of
 situationism, of Vaneigem's idea that we could build a cathedral
of poetry and love in which to carry out our everyday lives. </font> </p>

<p><font face="Franklin Gothic Medium">Scene 14, Noise and Silence, hints at the roots of situationism in avant-garde artistic movements 
such as Dada, surrealism, and the Lettrist
International (the immediate precursor of the Situationist International, from which it emerged in 1957). A chimp pronounces a
monologue into a microphone as a series of film clips (including Kurosawa's <em>Dreams </em>and
 a punk rock performance) play on a screen
behind him.  He talks about how art can be used to create subversive 
micro-societies, which open up new possibilities. Anything is
still possible, the talking chimp tells us, even though the world seems 
empty and degraded. True communication is the key. In a true 
situationist gesture, he eats his script at the end.</font></p>

<p><font face="Franklin Gothic Medium">The difficult path to 
authenticity is made more specific in Scene 20, The Holy Moment, when 
filmmaker Caveh Zahedi describes
Andr&#233; Bazin's theory that since God is in all reality, films are really 
attempts to capture God. When Zahedi and poet David Jewell try
to have such a moment, they are partially successful; yet Jewell 
confesses that he slips in and out of the moment, becoming aware of
the layers of reality embedded in such an attempt at real communication.</font></p>

<p><font face="Franklin Gothic Medium">
<img src="waking_essay_files/selfdestructiveman.jpg" align="left" border="0" height="218" hspace="10" width="187">Two scenes in <em>Waking Life </em>speak
 to the need for direct action to overcome the passivity and isolation 
of consumer society. In Scene
6, Self-Immolation, journalist J. C. Shakespeare douses himself with 
gasoline and sets himself on fire, just like a Buddhist monk in
Vietnam in 1963 who was protesting the treatment of Buddhists by the 
Diem government. Before doing so, Shakespeare speaks of
how the media uses images of death and destruction to turn us into 
passive observers, and how the only real freedom we're offered
is the purely symbolic act of voting. Human beings want chaos: we want 
strife, riots, murder, and war. The trick used by the media is
to paint a sad face on all these catastrophes, to pretend that they're 
avoidable tragedies. Yet behind this sad face is an attempt to
pacify us, to turn us into puppets of the spectacle. We sit in our 
living rooms shedding metaphorical tears for the deaths of thousands
in Bangladeshi typhoons or massacres in Rwanda, yet ten minutes later 
drive to the shopping mall for our daily fix of fast food and
maybe a shiny new commodity or two. </font> </p>

<p><font face="Franklin Gothic Medium">Radical broadcaster Alex Jones 
picks up this theme in Scene 10, when he rants from over a microphone 
and loudspeaker from the
front seat of his car of how corporate and political systems of control 
turn us into slaves. These systems turn loose greed, hatred,
envy, and insecurities to control us. They "make us feel pathetic, 
small, so we'll willingly give up our sovereignty, our liberty, our
destiny." Political parties are just different management teams taking 
turns exercising this control. Jones urges us to realize that we're
being conditioned on a mass scale, and that we have to "start 
challenging the corporate slave-state." He concludes that we've got to
get fired up about the things that really matter, "creativity and the 
dynamic human spirit that refuses to submit." Jones' rant has a
distinctly American flavour in its libertarianism and distrust of 
traditional politics. Yet its connection of individual freedom to 
creativity,
and his suggestion that systems of control use our own insecurities 
against us, is also situationist in spirit.
</font> </p>

<p><font face="Franklin Gothic Medium">Tentative solutions to the 
problem of the alienation of consumer society are offered in Scenes 24 
and 25. In 24, Tiana Hux says that all
communication winds up just keeping our "ant colony buzzing along in an 
efficient, polite manner."  Mocking everyday babble, she
asks Wiley, "Paper or plastic?", Credit or debit?", "Do you want ketchup
 with that?" Wiley goes on to quote the D. H. Lawrence
story about two strangers meeting on a road who decide to accept a 
confrontation between their souls, saying that this is like freeing
the "brave, reckless gods within us all," a comment that seems out of 
context for the sedate character played by Wiggins (even
though it's just a dream!). Hux's solution to our everyday lack of true 
communication is artistic: she wants to produce a soap opera
where the characters are the fantasy alter-egos of the actors. Yet 
whatever the potential for such a project to open up avenues of
authenticity for more than a handful of literati, Tiana's  cynicism 
about the flatness of everyday life, coupled with Wiley's idea that we
<em>can </em>actually have authentic, meaningful encounters with others, is once again situationist in spirit. Everyday life <em>can </em>be a cathedral of
our own making, if only we try hard enough.</font></p>

<p><font face="Franklin Gothic Medium">Lastly, in Scene 25, Speed 
Levitch speaks in favour of the ongoing wow and of direct experiences, 
quoting Thomas Mann to the effect
that it's better to participate in life than write a hundred stories. 
Towards the end of his speech he says that he wants to make love to
the paradoxes that bug him, and on romantic evenings of the self to go 
salsa dancing with his confusion. Indeed, the wild graphics of
the scene and Levitch's flamboyant manner, not to mention his concrete 
ideas and the fact that the scene takes place on the Brooklyn
Bridge, all suggest some heavy psychogeography going on in the 
background. New York City is to Levitch what the Paris of the 1960s
was to Debord and Vaneigem, a city full of exciting possibilities, the 
site of many a romantic drift.
</font> </p>

<p><font face="Franklin Gothic Medium">So the final wake-up call is away
 from the consumer spectacle, with its passivity and alienation, toward 
individual freedom and
creative activity (in both art and politics).  When we look back over 
the first two wake-up calls, we can see how they are all
connected: the Vedantist idea of the need to realize the unity of all 
things, the Taoist call to live naturally and spontaneously, the
Buddhist sense of mindfulness and rejection of attachments to a hard 
unchanging ego, and the existentialist reminder that we are
responsible, free beings who should live in good faith with our 
decisions. Natural, mindful, responsible thinking can also help us to
dissolve at least in part the spell of the society of the spectacle, to 
emerge from our immersion in false needs and the spider's web of
illusion spun by advertising and the media. <em>Waking Life </em>thus 
does good service not just as a sort of proto-philosophy class for the 
faint
of heart, but also as presenting us with a triad of wake-up calls for 
the self and its relation to society and the world as a whole. Its
didacticism aside, it reminds us that dreaming is something higher than 
everyday life - something that causes us to emerge from a
quotidian common sense into a sharper awareness of the human condition.</font></p>
